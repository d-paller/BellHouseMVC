<div class="page-div">
    <p>
        Bell House Restaurant, one of the finest places to have lunch and dinner in Shelbyville.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are in the heart of Downtown Shelbyville in a home that was fully renovated from 2007-2009 by Bobby and Sue
        Andriot. If you visit our @Html.ActionLink("About", "About", "Home") page, you can read about the progress that this house has been through in the past century.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are striving to be fine dining, but still delight in the "down home hospitality" that makes you feel welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no particular dress code. We offer a quite atmosphere, with soft background music to acompany you while you enjoy your meal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reservations are not necessary, but they are accepted and appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope your experience in Bell House is one that you desire to have again and to tell people about. Good service, good food, and a
        beautiful environment...you can't go wrong! We look forward to serving you!
    </p>
    <p>
        We offer a wide variety of services (see our about page to learn more), so if you don't see what you're looking for on the list, 
        please don't hesitate to ask! @Html.ActionLink("Contact Us", "Contact", "Home")
